<P><font face="Arial">

<b>VEDA LPR</b> represents our current software solution in the domain of
vehicle <b><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">license plate recognition (LPR)</FONT></b>, being
intended to automatically identify and recognize / &quot;read&quot; such license
plates in digital images.
<br><br>
The <b>VEDA LPR</b> engine not only represents an (Windows / <font color="#F00000">
32-bit</font>) extension, but almost a completely new design, development and
implementation, started from an old (DOS / 16-bit) LPR / ALPR / ANPR approach of
ours, namely <b> VEDA CAR</b> (1993-94).

<br><br>

The software may use, as input, both color and grayscale image files (grabbed
either by video cameras or by digital photo ones), and raw 256 gray levels
images already "prepared" in (a buffer of) the computer memory. It doesn't depend on
any specific image acquisition board (frame grabber). Supported image file formats
include: JPEG, PNG, PCX, BMP, TIFF and IMG (Imaging Technology 256 gray levels
uncompressed format).

<br><br>

<b>VEDA LPR</b> isn't directly meant as a universal and ready-to-run solution,
but merely as a foundation on which we/one can build customized <b> ANPR / ALPR
specific applications</b>.

<br><br>

Thus, once interfaced with some specific image acquisition chain (camera, frame
grabber, triggering devices), possibly a controller for an access device (gate /
barrier), and a database management software, the <b> VEDA LPR engine</b> can be
easily used to monitorize, control and/or validate the access in restricted areas,
public and/or private parking lots or garages, to monitorize highway (or other
roads) traffic, red-light or speed limit infringements, to control the input /
output at customs, toll collection points, etc.

<br><br>

A <a HREF="vlprsdk.html"><b> VEDA LPR engine SDK / API</b></a> is available for
developers / integrators.

<P><font face="Arial">
Same as for VEDA CAR, we designed the new LPR engine as having two main parts:
an <FONT COLOR="#F00000">image segmentation subsystem </FONT> and a
<FONT COLOR="#F00000">recognition / training (OCR) subsystem</FONT>.
The first one is meant to globally analyze a 256 gray levels input image and to
find the area(s) of interest potentially containing alphanumeric characters.
Once such an area found, it is converted to a monochrome bitmap, using a smart,
adaptive, binarization technique. Some &quot;noise&quot; filters and geometrical
distortions (skew, slant, rotation) compensation algorithms are then applied on
the obtained black and white bitmap. The next target is to split this bitmap
into rows of text (if needed), and these ones into their component characters.
Vectors of appropriate parameters are generated starting from these character
bitmaps, as internal representations for each one. These vectors are then
passed further as input to the second subsystem.
At this level, if the purpose is recognition, a powerful neural-like pattern
classification algorithm is used to &quot;identify&quot; them, based on (one
or more) existing OCR knowledge bases. If the purpose is training a (selected)
knowledge base, specific representations (patterns) derived for each character
sample, explicitly &quot;tagged&quot; interactively by the user, are &quot;learned&quot;.
A dedicated user interface is provided for this purpose.
Thus, on further recognition sessions, the system's experience is enhanced, and,
after a number of training sessions, the knowledge becomes good enough to ensure
average recognition rates above 99%.
</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">
In order to be as fast as possible, the global image segmentation system
(interest area finder) doesn't use traditional image analysis techniques
such as Fourier analysis, Sobel or Laplace edge detection methods and the
likes. Instead, we developed a &quot;contrast vaults&quot; analysis method
and algorithm for providing the most effective results. Briefly, a fast,
image-to-&quot;contrast vaults&quot; measure map, transformation is performed
on a per-block basis, i.e. a numeric value derived from an average &quot;contrast
vaults&quot; measurement is attached to each block.
Next, a conventional (histogram-based) method is applied on that map for finding
a proper segmentation threshold, meant to isolate &quot;blobs&quot; from the
background. Some filtering and connectivity analysis are applied on the initially
retained &quot;runs&quot; of blocks in order to obtain the candidate blobs.
These latter ones are subject of a blobs filtering process, and only the
appropriate ones are kept. Usually, area(s) containing the car license plate
proves to be (among) the remained &quot;blob(s)&quot;. Once the interest
area(s) thus segmentated, a smart, adaptive threshold based binarization (using
some statistical methods and several test points) is performed, and black/white
resulted bitmap(s) is (are) filtered of &quot;noise&quot;, de-skewed/de-slanted,
and finally passed further for segmentation to the recognition (or, respectively,
to the training) subsystem.
</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">
The recognition / training (OCR) subsystem is based on one of our proprietary
approaches / technologies in the field of neural and not-neural but somehow alike
classifiers. This technology features a high degree of noise tolerance and power
of generalization. It practically allows to learn and to further recognize any
graphic symbol. It is also used as the basic recognition / training engine for our
<a HREF="neurocr3.html">VEDA OCR/NeurOCR</a> application.
</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">
Our training experiments focused on car license plates were performed on several
hundreds (even thousands) of color and gray levels images, taken in various
conditions and at different resolutions (e.g. 640x480, 768x512, 768x576, 800x600,
1024x768, 1384x1030, and other - both lesser and greater - ones), with quite
various framing of the vehicles in the captured scenes also. These vehicles
mainly included Romanian (RO), French (F), Italian (I), Dutch (NL), German (D),
British (GB), Spanish (E), Slovakian (SK), Czech (CZ), Israeli (IL),
Brasilian (BR) and Hong Kong (HK) car license plates, but also American (USA),
Mexican (MEX), Belgian (B), Greek (GR), Turkish (TR), Australian (AU), and other
ones. This amount of training finally ensured very good average recognition
ratios. We emphasize again that the recognition / training system can, in fact,
recognize/learn any kind of machine printed text, if properly segmentated within
the image. For avoiding possible confusions / misnomers (like '1' with 'I', '0'
with 'O' or 'D', '8' with 'B', etc.) in real(-time) applications, a customized
list of allowed number formats / syntaxes may be defined and used as a
post-recognition automatic correction guide, from case to case, in such specific
applications.
